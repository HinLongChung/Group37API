This is an overview for the software of the Embedded System Project by Group 37 of UoM EEE

 Purpose  The purpose of this software is to drive a buggy autonomously along a track with white centre lines.

The buggy will achieve this by taking the reading from the sensors and adjust the PWM signal sent to the Left and Right motors accordingly.

 Hardware  The software is written for the \href{https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f401re.html}{\texttt{ STM32\+F401\+RE}} Nucleo Platform with the UM1601 Interface board.

Six \href{https://www.vishay.com/docs/83760/tcrt5000.pdf}{\texttt{ TCRT5000}} sensors are used.

Two \href{http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/dc-motors/2389715/}{\texttt{ RS Pro DC Motor 6-\/15V}} and \href{https://www.broadcom.com/products/motion-control-encoders/magnetic-encoders/aeat-601bf06}{\texttt{ Broadcom AEAT-\/601\+B-\/\+F06 â€“ Hall Effect Incremental Quadrature Encoder (256 CPR) }} are used
